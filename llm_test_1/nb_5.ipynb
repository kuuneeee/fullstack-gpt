      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 lb (450g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger\n",
      "- 1 tbsp garam masala\n",
      "- 1 tsp ground cumin\n",
      "- 1 tsp ground coriander\n",
      "- 1/2 tsp turmeric\n",
      "- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- Salt to taste\n",
      "- 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes\n",
      "- 1 cup heavy cream\n",
      "- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)\n",

      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, garlic, ginger, garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Preheat the broiler to high. Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and place them on a broiler pan. Broil for 12-15 minutes, turning once, until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred around the edges.\n",

      "\n",
      "7. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. Garnish with chopped cilantro.\n",
